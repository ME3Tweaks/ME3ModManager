Sounds like I missed a hell of fight, Shepard. Wish I could have been there. I'm not surprised you cut some kind deal with those bastards. But I don't trust them. Lost some good people down there. They get out line again, it's on you. 
Aralakh Company took some hits, but I'll make sure they give you a hand. Can't believe a war's going on and I'm stuck keeping the peace.

Commander Shepard:

I regret saying this in an email, but I am too far off to thank you in person for your work on Tuchanka. You saved not only the krogan homeworld, but the fragile alliance between our two peoples. 

Moreover, I am grateful you allowed my son to complete his mission. He died with the respect of his men. His sacrifice will go down as an important moment in the history of the Ninth Platoon. Any father would be proud.

Regards,
Primarch Victus</String>

		<String id="628985">You and everyone else.</String>
		<String id="628986">A krogan female of breeding age can produce clutches of up to 1,000 fertilized eggs over the course of a year.</String>
		<String id="628987">There are over one billion females on Tuchanka. If even one percent become fully fertile, they can birth ten billion infants.</String>
		<String id="628988">That creates close to Earth's population in a very short time. I want to know if you have considered how dangerous this is.</String>
		<String id="628989">Breeding laws have reduced populations among humans and salarians. There is no evidence that they work among krogan.</String>
		<String id="628990">The krogan are willing to fight and die for one child today. A larger clutch is an even better payoff, genetically.</String>
		<String id="628991">The attrition rate would naturally be high, but the state has an interest in keeping the children alive for warfare purposes.</String>
		<String id="628992">It is likely there would be many adoptions in the first few years. It would be prestigious to raise part of the new generation.</String>
		<String id="628993">That is true, but this war could last years. I encourage you to think of what a ten percent fertility rate could do over a decade.</String>
		<String id="628994">Please do. By the end of the war, there may not be enough soldiers left from Council species to control the krogan at all.</String>
		<String id="628995">Logistics. Even were they to side with us, transporting the krogan to the battlefields of Palaven could prove difficult.</String>
		<String id="628996">They have been demilitarized--that is, they have no warships.</String>
		<String id="628997">They will need turian or civilian starships to carry them to battle.</String>
		<String id="628998">Food. They will be unable to eat anything on Palaven. They must bring their own or rely on the nutrients in their humps.</String>
		<String id="628999">The krogan will also require sedatives, since krogan fight with others of their kind in enclosed spaces such as starships.</String>

		<String id="633291">Lieutenant Steve Cortez. Shuttle Pilot. I've got news about our supply chains, Commander.</String>
		<String id="633292">Sorry to just jump in, Commander. There's so much to be done, I get caught up in the tasks at hand.</String>
		<String id="633293">He's always like that. You need to chill out, Esteban.</String>
		<String id="633294">So you do care, Mr. Vega, or is that the Cerveza talking again?</String>
		<String id="633295">Alliance procurement chains are in chaos, but the Citadel's economy is still running.</String>
		<String id="633296">I can network to Citadel retailers. You can view inventory and make purchases right from this console.</String>
		<String id="633297">It does cost more to coordinate delivery to the Normandy, so it's cheaper to buy supplies when you're there.</String>
		<String id="633298">Commander. Need anything?</String>
		<String id="633300">I wasn't assigned as Normandy's pilot--not much need for one on a dry-docked ship.</String>
		<String id="633301">I was overseeing the retrofit of the cargo hold. I'm quite familiar with the operation and maintenance of the UT-47 Kodiak and the M-44 Hammerhead.</String>
		<String id="633302">With my experience, it made sense for me to take over as shuttle pilot when we left Earth.</String>
		<String id="633303">Especially given Mr. Vega's love of midair collisions.</String>
		<String id="633304">To save the day, pendejo!</String>
		<String id="633305">I'm also responsible for logistics, making sure the armory and shuttle are properly stocked and maintained.</String>
		<String id="633306">It was sent to the tech labs for a retrofit.</String>
		<String id="633307">To afford mobility with such a small eezo core, its design sacrificed armor plating. The lab engineers were trying to improve that.</String>
		<String id="633308">After the Reaper invasion, those labs are probably just a pile of rubble.</String>
		<String id="633309">Good eyes, Commander. This is the UT-47A Kodiak.</String>
		<String id="633310">It's got an upgraded eezo core and prototype stealth technology based on the Normandy design.</String>
		<String id="633311">For quick drops, I can get you in and out virtually undetected.</String>
		<String id="633312">She flies like a brick, so that's why you need a good pilot.</String>
		<String id="633313">About ten years. I enlisted in First Fleet serving on the SSV Hawking, flying F-61 Tridents, mostly. </String>
		<String id="633314">I love the Trident, practically dances in low atmo. I spent as much time tinkering on my bird as flying her. Got a bit of a reputation.</String>
		<String id="633315">Yeah, and I've got a knack for procurement, too. They were grooming me for CAG, but my skill set made me more valuable commanding a flight deck.</String>
		<String id="633316">They assigned me to the Normandy retrofit team about five months ago to oversee all cargo bay modifications.</String>
		<String id="633317">I'm an only child. Lost my parents years ago. I had a husband, back when I was stationed at Ferris Fields.</String>

		<String id="-2146847881">-1</String>
		<String id="635768">Correct. When we brought this unit on board, I began a background process to search for its information on the Prothean device.</String>
		<String id="635769">This eventually triggered a trap--a backup power source and CPU activated, and the unit attempted physical confrontation.</String>
		<String id="635770">Fortunately, I was able to gain root access and repurpose it as I saw fit. During this process, it... struggled. Thus, the fire.</String>
		<String id="635771">I reasoned along similar lines.</String>
		<String id="635772">Bringing the crew up to speed would have been counterproductive. All attempts to help would have been limited by reaction time.</String>
		<String id="635773">I exist primarily within the ship. For optimal control, this unit should remain within Normandy's broadcast or tightbeam range.</String>
		<String id="635774">Normandy's weaponry is not suited to every combat situation. This platform could provide limited-fire ground support.</String>
		<String id="635775">Correct. This body could accompany you to areas the Normandy cannot reach.</String>
		<String id="635776">Excellent. I will run tests to ensure that it matches or exceeds the capabilities of organic squadmates.</String>

		<String id="635778">One moment--I am running trials. Complete. I can send you a full report if you wish.</String>

		<String id="635780">An excellent point. I will take it to the bridge. Joker will also want to see it.</String>

		<String id="640010">Oh, it's no trouble, Commander. I'm sure you have larger concerns.</String>
		<String id="640011">My toothbrush is a Cision Pro Mark 4. It uses tiny mass effect fields to break up plaque and massage the gums. It cost 6,000 credits.</String>
		<String id="640016">Understood, Commander. And to be clear, I'm happy to be here.</String>
		<String id="640017">In any event, I appreciate you giving me the chance to stay.</String>

I had the new girl put in a holding chamber. The justicar who brought her to us, Justicar Phora, said she had trouble "convincing the prisoner coming to the Monastery was necessary." This may explain why the girl lashed out at her guards. She's lucky Phora wasn't here for that--the justicar's code would have demanded an execution.

I'll question some other justicars on the level of coercion Phora's permitted to use by the Code. This isn't the first time her "captures" arrived here terrified out of their wits, but it will certainly be the last.

You won't believe what Yanis managed to smuggle in: she grabbed a bunch of movies including a copy of VAENIA!!!! Meet us at 8:00 in the library. Rila's floor warden tonight, so act natural. Bring some classwork and say you're going to the library to study. We'll be by the east corner video banks. This is going to be so great. See you there!

PS: DELETE THIS ONCE YOU READ IT!!!!!</String>

I've shut down extranet access: we don't need people panicking from rumors of a Reaper invasion. I'll inquire as to what's really happening from High Command. If they're this silent, they must have forgotten us while something threatens Thessia.

I want you to take stock of our current supplies, just in case. Give me an inventory by tomorrow.

		<String id="645752">Soldiers are pure combat specialists: no one is tougher or more suited to taking down enemies with barrages of gunfire. Soldiers have thorough weapons training and can use all special ammo types as well as grenades. High-level operatives are outfitted with ocular synaptic processors that allow them to focus on targets with lethal accuracy.

Soldier Powers:
Adrenaline Rush
Concussive Shot
Frag Grenade
Incendiary Ammo
Disruptor Ammo
Cryo Ammo</String>
		<String id="645753">Adepts are biotic specialists, capable of disabling and killing enemies with raw biotic power. While they lack advanced combat training, they are the best at defeating enemies without firing a shot. They are outfitted with L5x implants that can spawn a micro-singularity, damaging enemies and pulling them into the air.

Adept Powers:
Warp
Throw
Shockwave
Singularity
Pull
Cluster Grenade</String>
		<String id="645754">Engineers are tech specialists, the most effective class at disabling the defenses of the toughest enemies or incapacitating them to render them harmless. In combination with their weapons training, Engineers have the unique ability to spawn combat drones that can harass enemies or force them out of entrenched cover positions.

Engineer Powers:
Incinerate
Overload
Cryo Blast
Combat Drone
Sabotage
Sentry Turret</String>
