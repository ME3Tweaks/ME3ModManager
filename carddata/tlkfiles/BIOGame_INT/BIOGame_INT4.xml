		<String id="607882">I can understand your rationale. You instinctively side with the familiar.</String>

One hemisphere of Vebinok is covered by surface deposits of oxidized copper. Approximately 270 years ago a turian bulk gas transport was attacked by pirates in the Phoenix system. Damaged, it made a rough landing on Vebinok. The heat of the landing melted significant quantities of surface ice, and ruptured shipping containers spilled LOX across the surface. Before this evaporated and escaped Vebinok's weak gravity, it reacted to cause the widespread rust.

Canrum was the site of the warlord Shiagur's defeat by turian peacekeeping forces during the Krogan Rebellions. While this band was not especially powerful, Shiagur was a female warlord--and one of the few remaining fertile females, at that. She had, through viciousness and cunning, parlayed her unique value into a position of power. Krogan males competed for the right to join her band and lie with her.

When Shiagur's death was announced, vengeful male krogan admirers near and far swore blood oaths against the participating turian crews. In the end, several thousand of the turian participants were killed in open combat or through assassination. To this day, many krogan proudly proclaim that they have the "blood of Shiagur."

		<String id="614447">Chohe</String>
		<String id="614448">Chohe is a terrestrial planet whose surface is mainly composed of aluminum, with numerous deposits of calcium. Though it has enough mass to retain a dense atmosphere, Chohe is nearly a vacuum. This lack of atmosphere allows a moderate average temperature, but the differences between day and night are extreme.

The surface of Chohe's sunward-facing side is usually covered by a haze of volatiles (mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide), which return to the ground as frost over the course of the long, cold night.

The Sirta Foundation has established a research outpost on Chohe to investigate the native subterranean life of Chohe, which shows incredible resilience to extremes of heat and cold.

		<String id="614451">Faringor</String>
		<String id="614452">A large but low-density terrestrial world, Faringor is generally believed to consist mainly of water ice. Occasional upwelling of metals, caused by the interacting tidal forces of several large moons, suggest the core is small, but extremely dense.

Faringor has a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide and ethane. Its frozen surface is mainly composed of dark carbon-laced water ice.

Thirteen years ago, Faringor's grim surface color and dim illumination drew the cinematographer Risa Uvarsen to film the exterior scenes of "Starless" on location. Acknowledged as a masterpiece of gothic horror, the sets--well-preserved by the vacuum--draw hundreds of tourists to the backwater system every year.

		<String id="614454">Treyarmus is a hydrogen-helium gas giant with a powerful magnetic field, making it a popular discharge site for freighters working the Anansi-Ishtar shipping route.

It is popular enough, in fact, that quarian ships can often be found loitering in orbit, selling the freighter crews cheap refreshments, salvage, and odd craftworks assembled by their children. There are no ships in orbit at present, however.

		<String id="614456">Juntauma is a small, broiling terrestrial world. Its thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide and ethane is being steadily "blown off" by the powerful solar wind from the star Farinata. The surface is scorching hot, and mainly composed of sulphur with deposits of copper. Its density is low enough to leave the world tidally locked to Farinata.

The Alliance Defense Data Network notes that several ships have been spotted cruising near Juntauma with transponders turned off. While an Alliance patrol attempted pursuit of one, the unidentified vessel "rabbited" to FTL. Its trail was lost when it obscured its light trace in the confusion of signals along the Anansi-Ishtar shipping lane.

		<String id="621581">After what happened to you out there in batarian space, I knew time was running out. For all of us. </String>
		<String id="621582">The Citadel Council was a dead end, so I did something I never thought I'd do. I went to my father.</String>
		<String id="621583">To put it mildly.</String>
		<String id="621584">So I went to my father and laid out everything we knew about the Reapers, from Saren all the way to the Collector base.</String>
		<String id="621585">I had to admit that parts of it sounded crazy. Meeting Vigil? Talking to Sovereign on Virmire?</String>

		<String id="621588">My father may have been a pain in the ass about rules and regulations, but he never let politics cloud his judgment.</String>
		<String id="621589">If the connections were there, he wouldn't deny them. And he saw what we always knew--the Reapers were coming.</String>
		<String id="621590">He did more than agree. He took it to the primarch.</String>

		<String id="621600">It's something I learned long ago in C-Sec: an imminent and painful death has a way of motivating people.</String>
		<String id="621601">Instead of questioning your every word, whole civilizations are going to be begging you to save them.</String>

		<String id="623021">That's not better, Tali.</String>
		<String id="623022">It's a risk, yes, but it's worth it when we need the stealth drive.</String>

		<String id="624639">The only way to save Palaven now is to hold our ships back for the Crucible. But if I'm wrong... then a lot of other turian families won't be as lucky as mine.</String>
		<String id="624640">If there are, I can't see them. It all comes down to the Crucible now.</String>
		<String id="624641">Yeah, there's that ruthless calculus again.</String>
		<String id="624642">Speaking of which, I hear the salarians are helping us out. How did you manage that?</String>
