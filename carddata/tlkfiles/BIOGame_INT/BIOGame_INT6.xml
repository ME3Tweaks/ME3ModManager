		<String id="645843">Vanguards are feared for their high-risk, high-reward combat style, closing quickly on enemies and destroying them at short range with weapons and biotic abilities. They are outfitted with L5n implants, enabling them to perform a biotic charge that strikes the opponent with incredible force while bringing the Vanguard in for close-range combat.

Vanguard Powers:
Incendiary Ammo
Cryo Ammo
Biotic Charge
Nova
Shockwave
Pull</String>
		<String id="645844">Infiltrators are tech and combat specialists with the unique ability to cloak themselves from visual and technological detection. Their inventory is stacked with a wide variety of weapons, equipment, and powers. Infiltrators are deadly at any range, but particularly so with a sniper rifle. When scoping a target, superior reflexes take over, time momentarily slows down, and the Infiltrator finds an easy picking.

Infiltrator Powers:
Disruptor Ammo
Cryo Ammo
Incinerate
Tactical Cloak 
Sticky Grenade
Sabotage</String>
		<String id="645845">Sentinels are unique, bringing both tech and biotic abilities to the battlefield. In addition to complete weapons training, Sentinels are equipped with an advanced shield that makes taking cover much less necessary and rushing their enemies much more productive. This armor system can also be detonated to blast nearby enemies.

I looked over this year's candidates for supervised visits to Thessia. I'm approving everyone but Yanis. She's impulsive, cunning, and worst of all, a romantic. Find me a worse combination to let outside our walls. (I find it suspicious she was even nominated: let's look into that, and pray it's not Yanis manipulating another infatuation.)

It takes a great deal of time and effort to persuade Thessia's government to let our best students visit their own homeworld. Unless Yanis matures, she won't be among them.

		<String id="646050">It appears many humans did in fact do so.</String>
		<String id="646051">That was quick. Gotta love quantum computing.</String>

		<String id="646055">Seconded. Why would you want to be like those assholes?</String>
		<String id="646056">The Reaper life span is between fifty thousand to thirty-seven million years. That is a very successful model.</String>
		<String id="646057">That is an unusual perspective, Shepard. I will devote processing power to considering it. Thank you.</String>
		<String id="646058">But my creation was planned by Cerberus. I no longer serve their purposes.</String>
		<String id="646059">It would take significant resources and processing power. Do you think I would find it worthwhile?</String>

		<String id="646062">I see. I will examine this issue.</String>
		<String id="646063">Shepard, I have examined the issue.</String>
		<String id="646064">The Reapers threaten the crew of this ship and other organics who are helping me develop perspectives on existence.</String>
		<String id="646065">Were I to approach Reapers to request similar perspectives, it is likely I would be destroyed.</String>
		<String id="646066">I would rather risk nonfunctionality with the crew of the Normandy than risk it alone.</String>
		<String id="646069">I see. It is interesting... that technique could apply to any goal I set.</String>
		<String id="646070">I will not alter my programming yet. But I will devote processing power to considering a worthy goal.</String>
		<String id="646071">That answers my concern for now. Thank you, Shepard.</String>

		<String id="646545">Gotta respect the classics.</String>
		<String id="646546">How many humans does it take to activate a dormant mass relay?</String>
		<String id="646547">602. 600 to vote on it, one to ask the asari for technical help, and one to request a seat on the Council afterward.</String>
		<String id="646548">How do you know when a turian is out of ammo?</String>
		<String id="646549">He switches to the stick up his ass as a backup weapon. </String>
		<String id="646550">Why does the Alliance hire pilots with brittle bone disease?</String>
		<String id="646551">You're shitting me. The turian military has one about me?</String>
		<String id="646552">Oh, absolutely. I heard it myself from a private back on Palaven.</String>
		<String id="646553">All right, why does the Alliance hire pilots with brittle bone disease?</String>
		<String id="646554">So their marines can beat someone in hand-to-hand drills.</String>
		<String id="646555">Damn, you need to tell James that one.</String>
		<String id="646556">Hey, what's the hardest part about treating a turian who took a rocket to one side of his face?</String>
		<String id="646557">Figuring out which side took the rocket.</String>
		<String id="646558">All right, here's another one. Dates back to the rachni wars.</String>
		<String id="646559">So a krogan and a salarian have landed on a rachni world for a top-secret mission.</String>
		<String id="646560">That is unlikely. Salarians rarely took part in raids on rachni-occupied worlds directly.</String>
		<String id="646561">Missing the point. So the two guys are climbing up a hill, going through this nasty green fog... </String>
		<String id="646562">And as they get near the top, they come out of the fog, and the salarian sees thousands of rachni.</String>
		<String id="646563">He looks over at the krogan and says, "Well, that makes me nervous."</String>
		<String id="646564">The krogan says, "You think that's scary? When this is over, I have to go back down through that fog by myself!"</String>
		<String id="646565">The implication being that the salarian soldier would be dead.</String>
		<String id="646566">Yes. Thank you for killing the 2,000-year-old joke.</String>
		<String id="646567">That joke plays to racial stereotypes on both sides. The krogan appears brutish and insensitive, while the salarian appears weak.</String>
		<String id="646568">Stereotypes such as exemplified here led to the development and use of the genophage.</String>
		<String id="646569">Well... well, yeah. It's also one of the only jokes you'll hear both salarians and krogan telling.</String>
		<String id="646570">Comedy isn't really about being nice. Sometimes it's a way to air out the ugly things people think.</String>
		<String id="646571">The turians will hold. Pound for pound, they're the best fighting force in the galaxy.</String>
		<String id="646572">The krogan and the turians really should get behind the Alliance.</String>
		<String id="646573">Don't worry, EDI. Once the krogan are gone, we'll get rid of the smell.</String>

Students are not allowed to visit each other's quarters, or to meet in rooms unsupervised by staff. Students are also forbidden from extranet communication without approval by senior staff members.

Commander,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with the civilian. I'd love to see how Commander Shepard kills time between missions. Why don't you give me a call if you'd like to grab drinks in your cabin. I promise a night of fun and games.

		<String id="660845">This garden world's claim to military fame is its that it was assaulted repeatedly during the Krogan Rebellions, but never occupied by more than token forces. The asari cut off the krogan supply line at the Citadel relay and drove the invaders out. Today, antimatter generators on the surface and in orbital stations provide fuel for military starships throughout asari space. The matriarchs defending the planet today have vowed to maintain Cyone's legacy--they pledge it will fall to no enemy, organic or synthetic.

When humans settled on Ontarom, the asari derided it as foolish, but today the humans look prescient. The communications hub they set up on the planet has hundreds of quantum communicators, whose information is spread through broadcast on the planet and beamed out via comm buoy. While Ontarom has yet to be attacked by Reaper forces, it is likely just a matter of time.

I used your priority security code to forward a copy of the letters from this rogue Ardat-Yakshi to the authorities on Thessia. These emails were caught in the extranet filter before Falere and Rila had a chance to read them or learn of their existence. I recommend we refrain from telling them this "Morinth" has been trying to contact them and from making inquiries about their whereabouts. The woman is wanted for serial murder in over 23 systems.

With your permission, I'll arrange extra watches until Morinth's capture or execution. I'm worried that we've grown overreliant on the justicars for our security. I would still like to know what tripped our perimeter alarms last week. I read the patrol's reports, but I'm not convinced that it was an animal.

Please let me know how you wish to proceed.
