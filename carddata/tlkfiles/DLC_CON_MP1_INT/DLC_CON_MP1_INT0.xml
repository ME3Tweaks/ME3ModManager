		<String id="728034">Kishock Harpoon Gun &lt;CUSTOM0&gt;</String>
		<String id="728035">Deadly one-shot batarian weapon. Causes bleed-out or disruption of target.</String>
		<String id="728036">An Alliance captain on her fifth tour of the Terminus Systems once said that seeing a Kishock was the easiest way to tell if she was being attacked by batarian mercenaries or slavers, since "no bastard with a Kishock means to take you alive." This powerful sniper rifle fires a harpoon-like spike that causes massive internal bleeding, and its miniaturized disruptors will also destroy synthetics. The rifle's biggest drawback is that it must be reloaded after every shot, but for those with steady aim and good timing, one shot is enough.</String>
		<String id="728037">Geth Plasma SMG &lt;CUSTOM0&gt;</String>
		<String id="728038">Fully-automatic geth submachine gun. Its rate of fire increases when the trigger is held.</String>
		<String id="728039">This submachine gun works on the same principles as the Spitfire: it shoots superconducting toroids that break apart on impact, retaining an electrical charge that flash-converts the shrapnel into plasma. Unlike the Spitfire, however, this smaller geth weapon has been modified to take thermal clips. Holding down the trigger speeds up its rate of fire, rapidly depleting the gun’s heat sink in exchange for nearly continuous fire.</String>
		<String id="728040">Striker Assault Rifle &lt;CUSTOM0&gt;</String>
		<String id="728041">Krogan rifle with explosive rounds. Its rate of fire increases when the trigger is held.</String>
		<String id="728042">The Striker is a fully-automatic weapon that functions more as a grenade launcher than a rifle, firing high-impact slugs that detonate on contact. The weapon increases its rate of fire the longer the trigger is held, which is devastating if the weapon can be kept on-target. In an attempt to market the Striker outside of the Krogan DMZ, the gun was designed to be fired by non-krogan, but its recoil tends to off-balance smaller species. Enthusiasts point out that the target on the receiving end of a Striker has far worse things to worry about than balance.</String>
