		<String id="312078">Siano, named for an ancient asari philosopher known for being a contrarian, orbits Dirada at a retrograde. It is believed to be an object that fell into the system millions of years ago from parts unknown. The outermost of Dirada's two asteroid belts is thought to have been a small planetoid that was broken up by Siano's passage into the system.

Siano is formed of low-density rock and is tidally locked to Dirada; the same hemisphere always faces the star. There is evidence that a complex of artificial structures once existed in the north of the sunward-facing hemisphere, but they have been badly degraded by millennia of heat and radiation. Several bunkers of radioactive waste, apparently byproducts of primitive fission plants, have been discovered on the far side. The Reapers appear to have ignored Siano, concentrating on systems with a higher population.

		<String id="312082">Canalus is smaller than Earth but has unusually high density. The high level of tectonic activity indicates that the density is caused by an abundance of radioactive materials in the core. These, combined with the planet's unusually high rate of spin, raise the planet's internal temperature and cause volcanism. While several companies performed mineral assays in the late 2170s, the world's geological instability precluded development.

Within the frost line of its solar system where gas giants do not usually form, Isale is believed to have once been extrasolar. With no infrastructure to speak of, the Reapers have ignored Isale as a military target.

		<String id="312361">Jonus, a methane-ammonia ice giant, is believed to be an extrasolar planet captured by its star. It was developed as a fuel depot serving the Pylos Cluster. Eldfell-Ashland Energy had established a base on one of its moons to crack water ice into hydrogen and oxygen and skim helium-3 from its atmosphere. The Reapers destroyed both the base and the abandoned infrastructure but not before triggering a trap--a crude nuclear device meant to catch them in its blast.

From orbit, the Normandy's sensors can pick out a sign that some waggish employee has left on the wreckage of the moon base: "Gone fission."

		<String id="319061">Cernunnos</String>
		<String id="319062">Caleston is the largest satellite of the gas giant Cernunnos. Ancient asteroid strikes deposited major lodes of element zero within the molten sulfur mantle. Eldfell-Ashland Energy's mining operations made it the largest source of starship drive core material in the Attican Traverse, which threatened Caleston's native biodiversity with industrial waste.

Caleston is wracked with volcanism due to tidal stresses from Cernunnos. Because of weak solar output, plant-like life on Caleston is not carbon-based and photosynthetic, but silicon-based and thermosynthetic, requiring heat rather than sunlight to power chemical reactions. These organisms flourish in volcanic vents and during solar flares, when Balor, Caleson's sun, can double or triple in luminosity. Oxygen-breathing habitation is not possible outside its many domed cities. Those cities are now feasts for the Reapers, who drove off Caleston's protective fleet and now threaten to puncture domes to force the population into submission.

		<String id="326700">Cernunnos is a sizable gas giant with high nitrogen content. It is believed to be an extrasolar capture due to its close stellar location. In a rare phenomenon, it is near enough to its red dwarf star to be within the life zone, although its massive size prevents the tidal lock that usually occurs at this range. 

While nothing could survive on the surface of a planet with such crushing gravity, Cernunnos' moon, Caleston, has life. Cernunnos was skimmed for its abundant hydrogen, and refineries on Caleston processed it into a metastable metallic form for use as starship fuel. The Reapers have since destroyed this operation.

		<String id="326825">A sizable hydrogen-helium gas giant just on the far side of its pale yellow star's frost line, Dranen is known for its spectacular storms. At least three persistent observable "spots", actually cyclonic and anticyclonic storms, have lasted for over 544 years--significantly longer than Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The largest of these spots, the Ishna, has consistently held a diameter over three times that of Earth.

Dranen has 44 moons. Two of them are of special interest to the Citadel Committee on Habitable Worlds. The first, Arvuna, is a life-bearing world that has already been colonized. The second, Alahya, is slowly being terraformed into an ammonia-based world for volus populations.

		<String id="326826">A hothouse planet, Agnin's scorching clouds of methane and sulfur dioxide give the planet a pale green color in visible light. The SO2 from volcanic activity rains down as sulfuric acid in the upper atmosphere, but this is boiled away before the liquid reaches the surface. Agnin's harsh environment has prevented exploration by anything except probes.

		<String id="326827">Shasu</String>
		<String id="326828">Shasu is a dwarf planet that is believed to have been ejected from Agnin during a giant impact with another planet-sized body. At the time, a magma ocean covered much of Agnin's surface; the liquid rock sprayed into space, where it coalesced and cooled over millions of years. It is theorized that during this cooling, Shasu orbited Agnin but was eventually pulled from that orbit by the gravity wells of other planets (primarily Dranen).

Today, Shasu is relatively temperate, with a light hydrogen-helium atmosphere that attracts spacers who use its atmosphere to refuel. Its crust composition is similar to Agnin, evident in its high sulfur content.

		<String id="326830">Arvuna, a moon of Dranen, is classified as a water world because oceans or ice cover 90% of its surface. Besides prodigious sea life, Arvuna is home to a host of venomous arthropodal pests in the tropical zone with metallic carapaces similar to those found on Palaven to resist radiation coming from Dranen's magnetosphere. There are several well-shielded human colonies on Arvuna, although they are alienated from the Council and politically insignificant to the Traverse and Terminus Systems.

The Reapers have yet to reach Arvuna, concentrating instead on the Balor system. While this cuts Arvuna off from the cluster's mass relay, it is at least some evidence that the Reapers cannot be everywhere at once.

		<String id="733620">A Systems Alliance official once summarized his tour of the vorcha homeworld as follows: "You can make your own Heshtok in two steps: take hell, then add vorcha." The planet is highly volcanically active, leading to periodic releases of toxic gases into the air and water supplies, as well as other extreme situations that gave rise to the vorcha's legendary adaptability. Overcrowding and the extermination of most of their ecology led to a planet covered in weeds and hardy vermin. 

The vorcha do not have a recognized single government that would allow them membership in any galactic league. Alliances between bloodlines are tenuous at best, and the vorcha's short, violent lives ensure there are few lasting institutions.

The Reaper invasion of Heshtok encountered little formal military resistance, but the harvesting process is slow. Destroying neighboring cities fails to intimidate vorcha, who become submissive only if physically dominated in person. Cutting off their water supply simply makes them adapt their bodies to get moisture from food. Allied intelligence hypothesizes that Reaper forces are not harvesting yet, instead seeking to immobilize Heshtok's population and prevent them from joining the fight for the galaxy at large.

Artifact P3X118
Hadley, Derek

Initial Tests:
Artifact tests negative for infrared and ultraviolet emissions. No gamma or X-ray radiation detected.

Follow-up Tests:
Artifact does not react to application of various stimuli. Internal readings inconclusive. No progress in determining age. Guess I stayed here all night finding out that this thing isn't really important. Fell asleep at desk.

Conclusion:
Artifact is definitely inert and safe. Recommend keeping it here for reference. We should all be near it. May be more useful than Leviathan in long run. Recommend we abandon hunt for Leviathan and seek more productive studies.

		<String id="752462">Right, but then what? It plays pretty rough, and if it is a Reaper, I don't know that's the kind of help we want.</String>
		<String id="752463">Sure, but then what do we do? It doesn't exactly play well with others. And if it's a Reaper, is that the sort of help we want?</String>
		<String id="752464">Absolutely. But then what? Say it is a Reaper. Do we really want its help?</String>
		<String id="752465">But after that? If it's a Reaper--even one that went rogue--do we really want help from something like that?</String>

The hull will hold--that's what they say. Whatever god watches over eezo prospectors came through for us. Despite a hell of a smack in the water landing, the MSV Monarch displaces enough air to stay afloat. We're all thankful we're alive. Captain Pratt even ordered the champagne broken out. Helps perspective, I guess.

The big puzzle? What downed us in the first place. Kunshan says it wasn't lightning; it was some kind of pulse. A directed-energy weapon seems likely, but where would it have come from? There's no radio traffic. The whole bloody ocean is silent.

Tonight the techs are going to try rerouting the power to get a good mass drop before getting the thrusters firing. If all goes well, we'll be airborne in 24 hours.</String>
		<String id="752587">Datapad Log: Shen Kunshan

Attempts to get airborne have failed every time. The damage done by the pulses, if you could call it damage, doesn't make physical sense. The connections aren't fried, but the Monarch's thrusters disengage. The distress beacon is likewise dead, but most of our electronics are still functioning. It doesn't seem to be a result of shielding.

Without a distress beacon, we've got no chance. I hear bad things about ration supplies, and I think that's why the captain ordered us to collect rainwater and set up tents on the deck. It keeps us busy. Brooks has been talking about using the Triton's weapons to try blast-fishing. I agree, but I haven't seen anything that looks like a fish.

I wish I were an optimist.

The rations will hold us two days more. Brooks sent a drone to the bottom, and it came up with bioluminescent plant life. None of it is edible. I warned the crew not to eat it before my tests were done, but Romero and Molins tried it anyway. They haven't stopped vomiting, and their dehydration wastes fresh water. 

We sent Kunshan's team on a raft over to the wrecks. They came back with spheres--some kind of organic-based alien technology--and nothing to eat. I want to believe they'll give us some answers, but if they had helped the other ships figure out what happened, they wouldn't be here, now would they?

It's getting cold.</String>
		<String id="752589">Datapad Log: Captain Abel Pratt

Ramos is our first death. He tried to throw one of the spheres overboard, and something happened. Kunshan and maybe three or four others started beating him like madmen. I wish I was quick enough to save him.
They showed no remorse, not even comprehension. It's clear I am no longer in control.
I held a funeral to keep order--the crew would have been at his body like wild dogs. We compromised: he will be tethered in the water to attract scavenging animals that we will catch for food. If he doesn't get a bite within three of this planet's days, we cut him loose as a water burial.

We've sealed the Tritons off. They're dangerous, especially given the crew's mental state.

My kingdom for a shark.</String>

The captain gets it now. He tried to lock himself in the ship, screaming that he had to fix it. 

We were gentle. One person for each limb. We let him rest on the sphere. Sometime in the middle of the night, he came around, and now he agrees. We won't leave. Why would we?

I think this will be my last entry. Everyone here understands me. If anyone finds us, they might feel differently, but that can be fixed in time.

		<String id="757439">A low-density planet in comparison to Earth, Triginta Petra is also drier, with wide land masses that are largely desert. Its dextro-chirality native life has yet to make it out of the oceans, primarily producing cyanobacteria which provide a limited amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. 

A handful of turians colonized the planet and attempted to introduce land plants. Their chief hurdle was the lack of good topsoil, which required imports and sophisticated farming practices to overcome. The farmer's maxim on Triginta Petra was "if you can last five seasons, you officially know what you're doing."

Preliminary scans of Triginta Petra suggest that the Reapers judged its population too low to harvest and struck its colonies with kinetic impactors. They then moved on, trusting that the destruction of the food supply's main arteries would finish off the inhabitants of such a biota-poor world.

Surveyors suspected Choitadix was once larger but was reduced in size by the strike, which knocked enough material out of the planet to create misshapen moonlets. Its name, which means "gap-toothed" in a common turian language, was retroactively added once scientists confirmed this hypothesis.
 
It appears the pulverized orbital stations here were abandoned as a preemptive move before the Reapers reached the cluster. The fate of the refugees is unknown. If they fled to Triginta Petra, the outlook is particularly poor.

The planet's light atmosphere of nitrogen and krypton is not overtly hostile to vorcha, but its heat makes it uninhabitable except in expensive habitats. Its low density precludes the presence of many valuable minerals, and so settling the planet was deemed not worth the effort.

After an economic downturn, however, many asari left the planet, and the vorcha population kept growing to the point where they bred faster than could be educated. Soon they turned violent and uncontrollable, and the colonies essentially self-destructed. 

Today, Namakli is a wasteland with little population, but vorcha packs are scattered across the deserts. Settlers frequently run into these packs, discouraging recolonization. The lack of complex biota and scarcity of profitable metals drove the last few proverbial nails into Namakli's coffin: no one has stepped forth in the past few years with the will, the funding, or the firepower to establish a permanent colony.

		<String id="758198">Camala is a relatively small but eezo-rich garden world recently colonized by the batarians. In an unusually open gesture, the batarians allowed immigration of free citizens of other species, so long as they came from independent colony planets such as those in the Traverse and Terminus and retained non-citizen status during their stay. These strictures were small obstacles compared to the economic lure of eezo, and soon the planet boasted spaceports and refineries that considerably enriched the Hegemony. The planet enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, with the major lifestyle inconvenience being fresh water shortages due to a dry climate.

The Reaper invasion has turned Camala's cities from affluent oases into a living nightmare. Alliance intelligence suggests that early in the Reaper invasion, a high percentage of the planet's population was captured and converted to husk creatures for future offensives. The processing camps still run night and day, and the troop transports fly legions of cannibals out every hour. For this reason, Alliance command has put Camala squarely in its sights for military strikes.

Within a generation of the vorcha's first contact with spacefaring species, robo-mining interests attempted to exploit it only to find their trading partners violently overthrown on a regular basis. The vorcha's own culture disenfranchised them in Naskral's case, as their legal claims to the planet were inevitably backed up by violence as a show of dominance. This nuance was lost on the mining corporations, who hired mercenaries to guard their operations with lethal force and never surrendered it to vorcha claimants.

The Reapers sent a small force to destroy Naskral's orbital stations and surface facilities. There is no indication that there are any survivors.

Several asari mining corporations, working with a siari-based charity called Mind and Hand, built settlements on the planet's surface and orbital stations. Adopting vorcha orphans from Heshtok, they raised them to live nonviolent lives and employed them in the mining industry. 

While Mind and Hand's efforts were at first labeled colonialist, the orphans became minor celebrities when it was discovered that the vorcha habit of using violence to communicate was not completely innate. Several spoke throughout Citadel space on behalf of their species, but their short life spans kept their careers very brief. Even today, companies that want vorcha labor have the poor choice between adopting and educating them as youngsters just to watch them age and die or dealing with autonomous but violent adults.

The Reaper invasion devastated Parasc. Its industrial capacity was ruthlessly targeted, and the vorcha mining communities were exterminated. The only silver lining is that the deaths here have created martyrs, inspiring other alien-raised vorcha to fight for their galaxy.

In reality, many of the ships were commanded by other species to avoid this shortcoming, but the insult still sticks.

The defenders outnumbered the Reapers, but their force was comprised of light ships suitable to a militia, since never before had it been in anyone's best interest to allow vorcha to build a dreadnought. Superior Reaper firepower soon wiped out the vorcha fleet, and the fuel infrastructure around Lihrat was pulverized. Rumors abound that the Reapers did not lose a single ship.

Altakiril's citizens were wiped out by Reapers bombardment despite the planet having a reasonably high population, which would usually make it a candidate for harvesting.

		<String id="758799">Chalkhos</String>
		<String id="758800">Chalkhos is notable for being one of the few garden worlds in the Milky Way that is also part of a binary planet system: both it and its heavenly twin Selvos are in a stable orbit with one another in addition to orbiting the star Mil. Chalkhos's greenhouse gases lead to a hotter climate than Earth, and the solar eclipses caused by Selvos, while common, are not frequent enough to be a good solar shade.

This did not prevent a colony from springing up, largely asari and their varying species of mates. It was far from an idyllic settlement--like many Terminus worlds, it was rife with farmers growing psychoactive substances, armed gangs, and with genetic engineering that would be illegal in Council space--but aside from the maddening heat and photoperiod, it was quite inhabitable.

The Reapers turned Chalkhos to rubble. Emergency broadcasts caught in the light-cone coming from the planet indicate that the Reapers used ground forces to invade and spent little time harvesting. As they departed, the Reapers bombarded the planet from orbit either because they needed to reinforce another front quickly or had gathered the data on genetic engineering they needed.

		<String id="758801">Selvos</String>
		<String id="758802">Chalkhos's binary twin is a barren world that's always seemed like a better terraforming prospect than it is. Its temperatures are quite tolerable for sapient life, and its gravity is suitable for retaining a thick atmosphere. Its location, close to Chalkhos, makes for a tempting investment--two garden worlds so close together would benefit from mutual trade and, if nothing else, tourism due to their near-unique status. However, Selvos has minimal water. Early attempts at creating a hydrosphere met with slow progress that only Chalkhos's asari could love.

The deaths of the colonists on Selvos and Chalkhos have dashed any hope for terraforming in the near future. Selvos is now a wasteland of punctured domed habitats and its orbital stations are slag. The Reapers have moved on.

		<String id="758803">A silicaceous asteroid, Mylasi is rich in olivine and pyroxene. The asari colonizing Chalkhos set up habitats on Mylasi mostly to oversee a large-scale project in which smaller asteroids would be flown to Chalkhos. There, the olivine would be recovered and used in sequestering the planet's carbon dioxide. As with many asari projects, this was expected to take decades or centuries before generating an appreciable effect on the planet's climate.

The station here has been bombarded by the Reapers. The effect on the integrity of the asteroid is unknown, but it does not appear to be breaking apart just yet.

		<String id="758804">Terapso</String>
		<String id="758805">A hydrogen-helium gas giant with an abundance of nitrogen in its atmosphere, Terapso was notable because of its independence from the government of Chalkhos as well as from any other governing body. As a result, its colonized moons and orbital stations overseeing the helium-3 recovery were neutral meeting grounds for all manner of deals between Terminus governments, warlords, or crime figures.

The Reapers appear to have cursorily bombarded many of the moons and machinery here. It is possible there are survivors. No plans exist detailing the extensive tunnel networks that were under the moons' surfaces, but it is likely that without rescue or food shipments, any inhabitants will die off soon.

However, this heat is not enough to instigate true melting as occurs in a planet's formation, so carbonaceous asteroids such as Beyalt retain a primitive makeup. Beyalt has yet to be exploited, so the Reapers appear to have ignored it. Probes suggest it is high in chondrites and troilite.

Though uniformly young by other species' standards, the Devils have laser-like focus on the task of taking out enemy ships. Courageous in the extreme, they are also notably disciplined for vorcha.

		<String id="758845">These socialized vorcha were a maintenance and calibration crew on a small scientific outpost orbiting Tyrix. Such skilled labor is rare among vorcha but not unheard of, since vorcha trained by other species for precision tasks develop finely tuned nerves and senses. Additionally, this crew can heal cellular damage caused by radiation exposure, which is useful since the Crucible is being built where no planet's magnetosphere protects it and extravehicular activity on its hull is often required.</String>

		<String id="758850">Radiation Shielding Sheath</String>
		<String id="758851">The Prothean device is being built in space, where its inner workings may be vulnerable to cosmic radiation from nearby stars. While the construction plan has taken standard risks into account, a sudden turn in space-weather could pierce the basic shielding and irradiate the device and crew. Superior radiation shielding used by the orbital stations near the gas giant Sineus would provide a low-cost way to keep the device safe against all but the most unusual energetic emissions.</String>

		<String id="758853">The biologists on Chalkhos have made a quick study of the brain structures of husks and other Reaper creatures. Isolating the parts of the brain responsible for interpreting sensory data, their conclusions contrast the various strengths and weaknesses of Reaper ground forces when it comes to sight, smell, hearing, and so forth. This data could be extremely useful for soldiers or citizens trying to escape and evade Reapers on occupied planets.</String>
		<String id="758854">Dextro Rations</String>
		<String id="758855">When they were struck by the Reapers, the agribusinesses of Triginta Petra had a surplus of both plant- and animal-based food products for dextro-amino-acid-based sapients. Both turian troops, who favor a meat-heavy diet, and the quarians, who are typically vegan, show a marked preference for these recovered rations, suggesting that although they were wiped out by enemy forces, the Petrans had pretty good taste. Serving Petran food to a unit about to go into combat can restore a little morale and dignity to an otherwise demoralized squad.</String>

On a large scale--and if given enough time--it could form an army of Reaper creatures dedicated to exterminating their own kind. The team's major limiting factors are the small number of artifacts and the reluctance of Alliance commanders to operate openly with such a potent weapon for fear the Reapers might develop a countermeasure.</String>

		<String id="759882">Essentially nothing was known of the aquatic species dubbed "Leviathans" before Commander Shepard's report to Task Force Aurora. No record of their species' true name exists, no ruins are attributed to their civilization, and no influence on other races has been recorded. The task force can only conjecture based on the limited information provided by Shepard. 

Their current world is unlikely their homeworld, so it is surmised that the Leviathans mastered technology and spaceflight despite their immense size and aquatic nature. Their ability to communicate with and mentally dominate land-based sapients would have been a necessary step, and so whatever homeworld the Leviathans hail from would have included a thrall species whose civilization served their purposes. Presumably their bodies can withstand both the extreme pressure of the depths and the lesser pressure of a coastal area where they might come into contact with these thralls.

Transporting a creature the size of the Leviathan into space would have been a significant engineering challenge. It is likely they used eezo for ease of travel, as the hanar do, and employed cybernetic filtration to breathe air as well as oxygenated water. It is unknown if the Leviathans have modified themselves with the equivalent of a biotic amplifier, but it seems probable. The faster-than-light communication of their pulses would require precise control previously unknown to modern science. One can only guess at the innovations of this species, and the Leviathans are volunteering no such information.</String>

The Thorian, a life form discovered on Feros, provides fascinating insight into the lifecycle of a truly alien species. Unlike conventionally intelligent life, it does not use mass relays; Prothean artifacts would not interest it.
	
Commander Shepard claims that "Reaper enemies" cultivated life to evolve along lines they could predict, using technology the Reapers controlled. The Thorian is an exception to that rule: it evolved to use organic tools rather than conventional technology.

Leviathan must be somehow similar to have survived undetected for so long. The Thorian used pain conditioning to control its victims, using them as manual labor--or even as a man would use his own hands and fingers. Commander Shepard claims that Reapers do the same thing through a different process called "indoctrination". Whatever Leviathan is, it must do something similar.</String>

		<String id="762621">All technology, and those who rely on synthetic technology for their survival, will be lost, yourself included.</String>
		<String id="762622">Your ships, weapons... even the relays will be destroyed. Your worlds will be in ruin.</String>
		<String id="762623">Few organics will survive the blast. Fewer still will survive the days to come.</String>
		<String id="762624">Your Crucible device is badly damaged. The blast it creates will be unpredictable.</String>
		<String id="762625">Many who rely on synthetic technology for survival will be affected. Some may even be destroyed.</String>
		<String id="762626">You will certainly die. It is possible that those further from the blast may survive relatively unharmed.</String>
		<String id="762627">Your Crucible device appears to be largely intact. However, the effects of the blast will not be constrained to the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="762628">Technology you rely on will be affected, but those who survive should have little difficulty repairing the damage.</String>
		<String id="762629">There will still be losses, but no more than what has already been lost.</String>
		<String id="762630">Impossible. You are vastly outnumbered.</String>

		<String id="762637">You could instead use the energy of the Crucible to seize control of the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="762638">Yes, but he could never have taken control... because we already controlled him.</String>
		<String id="762639">You will die. You will control us, but you will lose everything you have.</String>
		<String id="762640">Your corporeal form will be dissolved, but your thoughts, and even your memories, will continue.</String>
		<String id="762641">Your connection to your kind will be lost, though you will remain aware of their existence.</String>
		<String id="762642">And I do not look forward to being replaced by you, but... I would be forced to accept it.</String>
		<String id="762643">True, though you are bound to these decisions, just as I am.</String>

		<String id="762647">There is another solution.</String>
		<String id="762648">Synthesis.</String>
		<String id="762649">Add your energy to the Crucible's.</String>
		<String id="762650">The chain reaction will combine all synthetic and organic life into a new framework. A new... DNA.</String>
		<String id="762651">There is little time left, but I will try.</String>
		<String id="762652">Your organic energy, the essence of who and what you are, will be broken down and then dispersed.</String>
		<String id="762653">The energy of the Crucible, released in this way, will alter the matrix of all organic life in the galaxy.</String>
		<String id="762654">Organics seek perfection through technology. Synthetics seek perfection through understanding.</String>
		<String id="762655">Organics will be perfected by integrating fully with synthetic technology. Synthetics, in turn, will finally have full understanding of organics.</String>
		<String id="762656">It is the ideal solution. Now that we know it is possible, it is inevitable we will reach synthesis.</String>
		<String id="762657">We have tried... a similar solution in the past.</String>
		<String id="762658">But it has always failed.</String>
