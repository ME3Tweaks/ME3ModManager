How to use:

To decompile:
Drop a coalesced file onto the EXE to decompile the .bin file into .json files. It will decompile to a folder with the same filename (sans the extension) as the .bin file.

To (re)compile:
Drop the folder with the .json files that were decompiled (and maybe edited) back onto the EXE. It will make a new .bin file with the same name as the folder with a .bin extension.

If an error occurs:
Try http://jsonlint.com when compiling to see if your files have errors

All code in this zip file was made by Gibbed (Rick) at http://gib.me. FEMSHEP DID NOT MAKE ANYTHING IN THIS FOLDER EXCEPT THIS README!!

All that was done to make this version DLC editable was:

- Used revision 89 of Coalesce tool as base (14-Mar-2013)
- Applied patch that allows DLC editing (written by Gibbed, used in ME3 Explorer) (Source: http://pastie.org/private/1jmsgil9qsptdpxioxwctq#5,8,28,35,42-43,100,145,166,205)

All other code is identical.
