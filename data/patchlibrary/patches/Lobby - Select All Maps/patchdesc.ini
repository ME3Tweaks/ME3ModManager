[PatchInfo]
patchname = Lobby - Extra Maps
patchdesc = This patch makes the host think that all clients have all maps available. This will allow you to select the unreleased maps in the lobby without having to start the match first. This does not work around the issue where some maps simply are not selectable. When finishing a match it will reset to unknown because of those unselectable maps.
