## For developers
The master branch is code for the latest stable release. The dev branch is the working branch and contains the most up to date code but will be less stable and possibly non-functional. Pull requests move code from dev to master and include the changelog.

Mod Manager is compiled using Eclipse. Import the project and ensure all libraries are on the classpath. Additionally you will need to ensure non-code items that are embedded into the output jar are included (such as LauncherWV).
