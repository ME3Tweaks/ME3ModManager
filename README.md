# Mass Effect 3 Mod Manager
Mass Effect 3 [Coalesced] Mod Manager handles installing mods for Mass Effect 3. The Coalesced in the title is legacy, because this tool existed before we had the ability to edit other files.
It can install all types of mod, full files or deltas (MixIns), with automated backup and restores as well as merging mods, running AutoTOC on them, injecting keybinds, uninstalling custom DLC, injecting DLC mods...
